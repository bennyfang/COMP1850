				<h2 id="freq">My frequent site</h2>
				<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>: This is the biggest forum site in North America I browse that has content for almost anything you might be interested in. (e.g: news, politics, games, even cute things!) The main objective of the site is to have users to have discussions with each other about the topics that they like, as well as people who simply want to read about interesting contents other people write.</p>
				<p>The site divides the content really well - on top they have catogories including hot, new, trending, controversial, etc. that allows you to sort contents by user views and upvotes/downvotes. The contents are also divided into different subcontent pages, or what they call "subreddits", with links at the very top of the page above the logo. The "popular" subreddit is colored red to attract attention and to guide user who is browsing reddit for the first time to find topics that he or she might be interested in.</p>
				<p>The site also has an account system where registration is free, and users can subscribe to subreddits see only contents they are interested in. Other features include premium membership that you can earn, counts of upvote and downvote on their posts called karma, post history, and many more. This provides a more engaging user experience that encourage user to create more contents. Exclusion of any fancy backgrounds or images also elliminates distraction so that user can focus on browsing the forum.</p><br /><br />
				<h2 id="color">Example of a site with good color</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.zakkushi.com" target="_blank">Zakkushi</a>: Zakkushi is a group that runs several Japanese restaurants within Canada, with chains in both Vancouver and Toronto. I used this site as an example for color because the first thing that pops up when you visit the site is the food cover photo that fills up almost entirety of your browser. I like this style particularly because the vibrant color of the food not only outlines the appeal behind their food but also serves as a overview of different food that their restaurants have to offer. As you scroll down, you get a glimpse of all their restaurants under nav bar, as well as different color code for differnt restaurants and locations under that. This is then further utilized in their "What's new" section, in which different news has corresponding color code that indicate news about particular location the news has impact on. The medium dark theme also fits well with the atmosphere of their restaurants which tend to be little dark and fashionable. This page is a very good example of what I want to have since I'm also planning to create a food-centric webpage, especially their thematic colors and vibrant food photos. Overall I found their usage of color to be very creative and coherent with what they are trying to achieve, which is to appeal to potential customers.</p><br /><br />
				<h2 id="layout">Example of a site with good layout</h2>
				<p><a href="https://www.airbnb.ca" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>: Airbnb is a site that allows people to post their homes or vacant houses for short term stay targetted towards tourists or temporary visitors. The layout of the site utilize a more minimalism approach of white background and uncluttered, graphical contents that attracts users' attention. It starts with a search bar at top for quick courtesy navigation/search, in which the users' (the tourists') primary goal is to find lodging of their interested locations. The nav to its right is also kept minimalistic with only 4 options for new users to select (sign up, become a host, login, help). Underneath the nav bar are contents divided into subsections for users to explore potential place to stay in case they have yet to decide where to go. Sections like popular reservation and featured destinations, for example, are contents Airbnb included to help the user with that decision. If you are already a registered user, your previous destinations and related entries are also shown as you scroll down further, and I particularly like graphic display they put under every single one of their entries. At the end of the page you will find more of the nitty gritties such as About Us and Term of Use, followed by stuff like Copyright and Site Map at the very bottom, which are all less important contents for users. The only complaint I have is the length of scrolling users might have to perform to get to the section they want to view, but overall I really like this design approach for modern website.</p><br /><br />
				<h2 id="avoid">10 things to avoid while designing your website</h2>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Not following common website design conventions</strong>: While it might be a good idea to think outside of the box, ditching common design practices such as placing your logo at the top left of the page or log in button at top right will confuse your users, who expect these things at their usual places.</li>
					<li><strong>Lack of &lt;h1&gt; tagged page title text</strong>: Having no title on your page is especially bad for users who are trying to figure out the main topic of your page. It also prevents the search engine from easily discovering what your page is all about.</li>
					<li><strong>Lack of easy navigation</strong>: Follow the 3-click rule - if your users can't get to where they want in 3 clicks or less from any page on your site to another, you should consider improving your navigation system.</li>
					<li><strong>Overly-complex navigation</strong>: Lack of easy navigation being said on previous point, you should also not make your navigation with drop down of 20 different pages each such that users are confused about what to click to go to the page they want to go. Consider adding more local navigations on your subpages instead.</li>
					<li><strong>Cluttering contents</strong>: Do not squish your content together such that there is barely any white space left. This gives the user a claustrophobic feeling that you want to avoid.</li>
					<li><strong>Lack of consistency accross pages within the same domain</strong>: You probably don't want to create subpages on your site that are completely different from your main page. There should be a common "theme" across all of your pages to avoid confusion (you know you are still on pages related to the site while browsing).</li>
					<li><strong>Lack of contrast in color between contents</strong>: Picking two similar types of red to use for your text is most likely a bad idea due to bad readability and lack of differentiation between background and content. Two relatively contrasting colors are the way to go, along with additional colors for different elements such as links and navigations.</li>
					<li><strong>Bad ordering of contents</strong>: The ordering of contents, for example the nav bar links, are there to indicate their degree of importance. Putting nav links such as About Us before your Product link is most likely a bad idea unless your website is all about introducing your company to your users.</li>
					<li><strong>Auto-play video/audio</strong>: This may be more of a personal opinion but any site that force play a video or an audio on visit without users' consent may be annoying or even repel potential users from ever visiting. The users should decide whether they want to hear or see your contents, not you!</li>
					<li><strong>Unrelated contents</strong>: If you are running a cafe site and you post pictures of random puppies that you find cute (unless you are running a puppy cafe), it's probably not related to your website and only serve as a distraction to the main contents on the page.</li>
