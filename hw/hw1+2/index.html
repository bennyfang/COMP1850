		<h1>Welcome to Benny's website!</h1>
		<p>Hi! My name is Benny and I took my undergraduate degree at University of Toronto for its computer engineering program. The program offers a wide scope of courses, but the languages used were not reflective of modern programming, especially web and mobile programming which I have been interested in a while. I am currently working as software consultant for a company in Toronto remotely but I have spare time off work and therefore would like to expand my knowledge during that down time to learn more about web design and programming. I have done some studies on my own before, but by taking this course and COMP1950 later this semester I hope to at least be capable of writing up my own webpages and develop my career in this area.</p>
		<p>A bonus joke: Why did the idiot throw the clock out of the window? Because he thought time flies.</p>
