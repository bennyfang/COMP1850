		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Nano is a singer who originally posted music on YouTube and the Japanese site Niconico before being signed by a record label. She was raised in the United States as a child but then moved to Japan when she was an adult.</p>
		<p>Nano posted covers of Japanese anime and Avril Lavigne songs online, first on YouTube and later on Niconico. She is bilingual, and sometimes writes English lyrics to the covered songs, giving them a western touch without losing the original style. Eventually this led to a record deal with Japanese major label Flying Dog.</p>
