			Include a navigation menu of links to each of the other three pages. All three pages should be interlinked. The navigation should have the same style and position on all pages. Include on index.html your full name. Using the textbook or online resources, learn about two new HTML tags that are not covered in COMP 1850 curriculum (do not choose any form related elements such as the input tag). Deploy the new tags on this page and include text that explains what you chose, and what semantic value, if any, the tags possess. Also explain and demonstrate the use of some of these tagsâ€™ attributes and/or CSS properties.

			<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
			<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
