		Image:
		Obtain a copy of the file named source.bmp located on the share OUT server. Open
		source.bmp in an image manipulation application such as photoshop, and create a new
		image that:
		- is rotated right-side-up
		- is resized so that it is 400pixels wide.
		Ensure the height is scaled appropriately so that the image is not stretched or skewed.
		Include the text ‘COMP1850’ somewhere. Apply a layer effect(s) to the text. Save the
		image as a file type appropriate for the world wide web.
		Deploy this image within the HTML page.
		The HTML page should display the image actual size (400px wide)

		Tutorial:
		Find a photoshop tutorial online that demonstrates how to create one of the following:
		- A text effect
		- A button
		- Any technique you find useful and interesting
		Demonstrate what you have learned from the tutorial by briefly describing what you
		have done, and showing an example of an image(s) you created using the tutorial. Be
		sure the example image you create is different somehow to the image in the tutorial
		(eg: if you chose a text effect tutorial, use your name as the text in the image you
		create). Include a link to the tutorial you chose.

			<h1>COMP1850 Homework 4</h1>
			<h2>Image</h2>
			<p>The original image has been rotated, resized and filtered as shown below. I have also included COMP1850 text and its border layer on the image:</p>
			<img src="img/edited.png" alt="COMP1850 edited image" /><br /><br />
			<h2>Tutorial</h2>
			<p>I have designed a button as shown below:</p>
			<img src="img/button.png" alt="COMP1850 Tutorial Logo" />
			<p>This button was created with the free GIMP software, instead of photoshop, and I followed a button tutorial that is available <a href="https://turbofuture.com/graphic-design-video/CreateasquareglossybuttoninGIMP28tutorial" target="_blank">here</a>. In this tutorial, I learned the usage of various different layers to create gradients and outline borders, as well as the basic usage of the GIMP tool.</p>
			<p>To start with, I created the red portion of the button as well as its border layers. Then the outside (white and grey) portion of the button was created through various gradients of the tool. Then, I gave my button a pattern inside using palm trees instead of carbon fiber in the tutorial since that option doesn't exist in my mac version. Then, I gave gradients inside the button as well to create contrasting shades. In addition, the white "on/off" portion of the button was drawn using partially erased circle and a straight line. I also gave it a little border slightly shifted down for 3D effect. Last but not least, I included COMP1850 text at the top using a contrasting blue color to indicate that I was indeed the one who created this button.</p>
